``POPCORN`` is a package that uses singular value decomposition to perform
low-rank data denoising and reconstruction. It takes a tabular
data matrix and an error matrix as input and returns a denoised version
of the original dataset as output. The approach enables a more accurate data analysis with a wide range of uncertainties. 
Consequently, this package can be used as a simple toolbox to perform astronomical data cleaning.


How to install ``POPCORN``
==========================

The ``POPCORN`` can be installed via the PyPI and pip:

::

   pip install popcorn

If you download the repository, you can also install it in the ``popcorn`` directory:

::

   git clone https://github.com/pengchzn/popcorn
   cd popcorn
   python setup.py install

How to use ``POPCORN``
======================

Here is an easy example for the use of ``POPCORN``

::

   import popcorn
   import numpy as np

   #import the data
   X = pd.read_csv('./datasets/Xobs.csv')
   Xsd = pd.read_csv('./datasets/Xsd.csv')

   # put the data into the algorithm
   # Get the value
   U, S, V = popcorn(X, Xsd, 2)
   
   # Get the denoised data
   result = U @ S @ V.T

After the ``POPCORN`` procedure, you can connect any additional algorithms or models to the denoised data.

Here is the distribution of noisy data and the distribution of denoised data in our test case:

.. image:: https://github.com/pengchzn/popcorn/blob/main/tests/figures/Denoised_data.png

We also mimic how the data is used on a daily basis, run the HDBScan on both sets of data, and visualize the findings.

You can test the test example in this `notebook <https://github.com/pengchzn/popcorn/blob/main/tests/test_popcorn.ipynb>`_ locally by yourself! If you are new to Python or don't know how to run ``POPCORN`` locally, you can click `here <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nT4M90_VE-lX0L9d_XPg70QOTkuVbAZO?usp=sharing>`_ to create a new Colaboratory notebook, so you can run ``POPCORN`` in the cloud!


Requirements
============

-  python 3
-  numpy >= 1.21.0
-  Scipy >= 1.7.0

``Popcorn`` primarily uses the most recent version of ``Scipy`` for single value decomposition. 
Make sure your ``Scipy`` installation is up to date before using ``popcorn``.
